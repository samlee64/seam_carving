First run:
- Trigger executable
- "Refresh" button on the UI that just checks up on backend to see if the files have been written



Goals:
Have a display of all images (both base and uploaded ones)
Click on an image and you can see all the processing that went on
Similar UI to the gifs



Implement this with sockets
